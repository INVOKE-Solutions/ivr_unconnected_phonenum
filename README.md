# IVR Unconnected Phone Numbers
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://ivr-unconnected-phonenum.streamlit.app/)

This app removes connected phone numbers from IVR raw results and churn out unconnected ones to be re-used in the next round of IVR.
